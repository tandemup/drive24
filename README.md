Parking finder

I've thought a very useful feature to automatically save the last location where we have parked our car is making use of Bluetooth connection between our iPhone and the Bluetooth radio of our car. We should indicate to our app which is the Bluetooth id name of our radio and listening connections and disconnections of Bluetooth pairing when we start car engine and when we stop it. This two events are a great opportunity to share anonymously car location and free/occupied status of that spot to manage the parking of public hospitals, libraries as secondary app aim. First aim is remember where we have parked our car for the last time
